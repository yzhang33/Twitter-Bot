This is twitterman who tweets a chinese words with english translation below every hour. The inspriation is from every word twitter Dan showed us a glimpse of it. 
### Dictionary
At first I thought of using dictionary and google translation but I tried out some google translations they are just not that perfect. Then I downloaded a dictionary with legit English translation. 
The parsing part is tricky somehow. Because it was not in the formate I wanted. I have to use regex to parse the whole file and put the desired data into an array. 
### Hosting Bot in Cloud
I also hosted the bot in Heroku which keep this bot running "forever". It is vert useful for my bot and I dont have to run my node.js file when I restart my computer.
### Code of Conduct
Thje dictionary has some words which may make people uncomfortable. I manaually went thorough it and deleted some words(there are 1.2 million of them!). Fortunately, I did not frek out.
